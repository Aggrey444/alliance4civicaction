                    <strong>Press Release</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>The Minority In Ghana's Parliament is a 'waste'</strong><br>
                    <strong>Alliance for Civic Action (ACA)</strong><br><br>
              
                    Accra, Ghana – February 27, 2025<br><br>
              
                    The Alliance for Civic Action (ACA), a civil society organization committed to promoting transparent governance, accountability, and the principles of good governance and peace, expresses profound concern over the recent conduct of the Minority Leader, Hon. Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin, during the parliamentary vetting process.<br><br>
              
                    On February 26, 2025, during the vetting of Deputy Attorney General and Justice Minister-designate, Justice Srem-Sai, an incident occurred that has raised serious questions about the decorum and leadership within our parliamentary proceedings. Hon. Afenyo-Markin posed a question to the nominee, requesting him to demonstrate a cultural dance from his heritage, stating, "We are here to learn about our country. It is also about our culture."<br><br>
              
                    The Chairman of the Appointments Committee, Hon. Bernard Ahiafor, overruled this question, deeming it inappropriate for the setting, and stated, "Honourable nominee, the question is overruled. You are not going to answer that question."<br><br>
              
                    In response, Hon. Afenyo-Markin accused the Chairman of being "whimsical and capricious" in his handling of the proceedings. When the Chairman demanded a withdrawal of these remarks, Hon. Afenyo-Markin refused, further stating, "Chairman, I will not withdraw. You rudely overruled me."<br><br>
              
                    Such conduct not only undermines the integrity of our parliamentary processes but also reflects a troubling lack of leadership and decorum expected of someone in his esteemed position. The ACA is particularly alarmed by the Minority Leader's apparent impatience and his propensity to resort to confrontational tactics, which have led to unnecessary tensions and disruptions within the legislative body.<br><br>
              
                    The recent boycott by the minority during the vetting committee sessions is a glaring manifestation of intolerance and a blatant disregard for parliamentary principles and the rule of law. Hon. Afenyo-Markin's refusal to retract unacceptable remarks directed at the committee's chairperson further exemplifies a concerning level of arrogance and disrespect.<br><br>
              
                    In light of these developments, the ACA calls upon all Ghanaians to recognize the gravity of this situation. It is imperative to address these issues promptly to prevent potential chaos and to preserve the sanctity of our parliamentary democracy.<br><br>
              
                    We are in an era that demands collaborative teamwork, mutual respect, and a unified commitment to nation-building. The time for individualistic displays of authority has passed. It is essential for our leaders, especially those within the minority caucus led by Hon. Afenyo-Markin, to adopt a more constructive and cooperative approach. The current trajectory of incessant disruptions and confrontations is detrimental to our democratic fabric.<br><br>
              
                    The ACA urges the minority leadership to reflect on their actions and to realign their strategies in a manner that fosters productive discourse and upholds the dignity of our parliamentary institution. Our democracy thrives on healthy debates and collaborative efforts, not on discord and disrespect.<br><br>

                  We, the members of ALLIANCE FOR CIVIC ACTION strongly condemn the unjust arrests and inhumane treatment of citizens protesting against illegal mining, commonly referred to as Galamsey.

                    <strong>Enough of the Arrest, MR. President: Fix the galamsy mess'</strong><br>
                    <strong>Alliance for Civic Action (ACA)</strong><br><br>
              
                    Accra, Ghana – September 25, 2024<br><br>
              
                    The government's failure to effectively address this issue, despite substantial financial investments in its so-called fight against Galamsey, remains deeply concerning. Additionally, the continued issuance of licenses to miners within our forest reserves exacerbates the situation, which should be the government's focus.
                    The destruction caused by Galamsey is immense, with thousands of acres of forests, farmlands, and even protected reserves being devastated. Our rivers are not spared either, with many being heavily polluted. This has left entire communities without access to potable drinking water due to contamination from illegal mining activities.
                    We ask the critical question: why does the President remain indifferent to the environmental and societal destruction caused by Galamsey, yet swiftly arrests protesters? Which of these issues poses a greater threat to the nation and its people?
                    We call on the President to shift his focus and fix the Galamsey mess instead of targeting innocent protesters. The real crisis facing the state is illegal mining, not the peaceful citizens voicing their concerns.
                    We also recommend that all political actors, especially the President and his government appointees, demonstrate greater tolerance. Furthermore, we urge the police to maintain professionalism and neutrality to ensure a peaceful and fair election process.
                     
                    <br>
                    Fix the Galamsey Mess, Mr. President.

                      1.Digitalization: An Ongoing Initiative, Not a Revolutionary Solution
                         Digitalization has been an ongoing evolution in Ghana. From the Ghana Card to mobile money interoperability, previous administrations, including John Mahama’s, laid the foundation for digital advances, making it a continuation rather than a unique promise. Given the global momentum toward digital transformation, Ghana’s digital evolution will naturally persist, driven by both public and private sectors. However, this does not directly address the country's immediate economic crisis.

                      2.The 24-Hour Economy: A Structural Transformation
                          The 24-hour economy proposed by John Mahama, on the other hand, presents an entirely new approach that would increase productivity, drive economic growth, and alleviate unemployment. Operating key sectors—manufacturing, healthcare, retail, transportation, and logistics—around the clock can provide substantial economic benefits, creating a cycle of growth that digitalization alone cannot achieve.

                      3.How a 24-Hour Economy Addresses Ghana’s Current Economic Woes
                        Debt Management and Revenue Growth
                        Ghana’s debt-to-GDP ratio currently stands at alarming levels, above 70%, with national revenue falling short of meeting debt obligations. By increasing economic activity through a 24-hour operation, Ghana can generate more revenue across sectors, potentially adding billions of cedis in GDP growth over time. This additional revenue could lessen our debt burden and reduce our reliance on external loans.

                        Job Creation and Lower Unemployment
                        Youth unemployment remains high, with approximately 12% of young Ghanaians lacking employment. A 24-hour economy would create diverse employment opportunities by operating multiple shifts, immediately addressing job scarcity. Sectors such as retail, healthcare, security, and transportation would need more workers, reducing unemployment and uplifting the economy.

                        Controlling Inflation and Stabilizing the Cedi
                        A 24-hour economy could stabilize inflation by increasing production and lowering costs through economies of scale. More products and services available round-the-clock would reduce inflationary pressures. Additionally, with increased productivity, Ghana’s reliance on imports could decline, stabilizing the cedi and improving exchange rates.

                        Comparative Figures
                        Unemployment: Current rate at approximately 12%; projected reduction by 3-5% within the first five years of a 24-hour economy implementation.
                        Debt-to-GDP Ratio: Currently above 70%; increased GDP through a 24-hour economy could reduce the debt ratio by generating internal revenue and decreasing the dependency on loans.
                        Inflation Rate: Currently over 40%; by increasing domestic production and minimizing import reliance, inflation could be contained to manageable levels.

                        Exchange Rate: The cedi has depreciated significantly against the dollar. With increased exports and decreased import reliance, we could stabilize the exchange rate, lessening the cedi’s vulnerability.


                    4. Digitalization as a Support Mechanism, Not the Core Solution
                        Digitalization remains an essential part of a modern economy but should act as a supportive tool within the 24-hour economic framework. The ongoing digital systems, such as mobile payments and digital ID systems, will support the 24-hour economy by increasing efficiency but cannot independently drive economic growth or job creation.

                    5. Why Ghana Needs the 24-Hour Economy Now
                       In a country facing a mounting debt crisis, high inflation, and an employment crisis, we need policies that provide real, immediate solutions. The 24-hour economy is a visionary yet pragmatic policy designed to drive economic stability and growth. Ghana’s challenges require an economic shift that can bring tangible results across all sectors, from industry to services, creating jobs, stabilizing the cedi, and reducing our debt.

                      Conclusion: Choose Transformation Over Continuation
                      The Alliance for Civic Action calls on all Ghanaians to critically examine the options before us. While digitalization is a necessary process that will continue regardless of leadership, the 24-hour economy presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform Ghana’s economic structure fundamentally. We urge you to support a policy that aligns with Ghana's current economic needs and to choose the future that a 24-hour economy promises—a Ghana that works for all, around the clock.

                    <strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Alliance For Civic Action Condemns Minority Leader’s Rush to Supreme Court over Parliamentary Issues</strong><br><br>
              
                    The Alliance For Civic Action (ACA) has observed with concern the recent developments in Ghana's Parliament, notably the rushed decision by the Minority Leader, Hon. Alexander Afenyo-Markin, to seek Supreme Court intervention on a matter clearly within the purview of parliamentary procedure. This action underscores a lack of experience in handling parliamentary affairs and threatens the autonomy of Parliament as a co-equal branch of government.<br><br>
              
                    In what we believe to be a misguided appeal, Hon. Afenyo-Markin is reportedly seeking the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Article 79(1)(g) of the 1992 Constitution. However, the Constitution itself is clear: matters relating to parliamentary elections fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the High Court, as outlined in Article 99. The Minority Leader’s actions not only contravene established parliamentary norms but also cast doubt on his commitment to upholding the sanctity and sovereignty of Parliament.<br><br>
              
                    This unusual approach, coupled with the Supreme Court’s swift ruling, raises questions about the impartiality of this intervention. For decades, parliamentary leaders, including Hon. Osei Kyei Mensah-Bonsu and Rt. Hon. Alban Bagbin, have upheld Parliament’s independence by resolving its matters internally. ACA firmly believes this respect for legislative sovereignty is critical in maintaining a balanced, functioning democracy.<br><br>
              
                    Alliance For Civic Action is calling on the Supreme Court to exercise restraint and defer to Parliament’s authority in addressing its internal matters. Parliament must retain the ability to interpret and enforce its rules without undue judicial interference, safeguarding its role as a co-equal arm of government.<br><br>
              
                    In the spirit of upholding Ghana’s democratic principles, we urge all Ghanaians to remain vigilant and committed to the rule of law. The stability of our democracy relies on mutual respect between the judiciary, legislature, and executive.<br><br>
              
                    <strong>Signed,</strong><br>

                    <strong>Explaining John Mahama’s "Big Push" Initiative: A Transformative Plan for Ghana's Economy</strong><br>
                    <strong>Alliance for Civic Action (ACA)</strong><br><br>
              
                    Accra, Ghana – November 14, 2024<br><br>
              
                    The Alliance For Civic Action (ACA) is proud to endorse and bring to the public’s attention an important aspect of former President John Dramani Mahama’s plan for Ghana’s development — the “Big Push.” As the 2024 elections approach, it is essential for Ghanaians to understand the vision and transformative policies that John Mahama offers to move our nation forward.<br><br>

                    The “Big Push” initiative is a comprehensive economic strategy aimed at transforming Ghana through a significant infrastructure investment drive. This ambitious plan addresses Ghana’s immediate infrastructure deficits while laying a solid foundation for sustainable economic growth, job creation, and the improvement of living standards for all Ghanaians.<br><br>

                    <strong>1. Massive Infrastructure Development</strong><br>
                    The Big Push is committed to addressing Ghana’s infrastructure needs. It envisions the construction and improvement of roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, and housing to ensure reliable infrastructure across the nation.<br><br>

                    <strong>2. Job Creation Through Local Investments</strong><br>
                    The initiative will generate thousands of jobs, especially for the youth, by empowering local contractors and businesses, thereby stimulating local entrepreneurship and economic activity.<br><br>

                    <strong>3. Public-Private Sector Partnerships</strong><br>
                    The Big Push seeks to bring in public and private investment, encouraging partnerships that enable large-scale development projects through collaborative efforts with local and foreign investors.<br><br>

                    <strong>4. Sustainable Funding Strategies</strong><br>
                    Funding will be sourced through a responsible mix of public financing, bonds, and PPPs. The plan ensures sustainability without overburdening the national budget.<br><br>

                    <strong>5. Social Infrastructure: Health and Education</strong><br>
                    The initiative also includes major investments in health and education — more hospitals, schools, better equipment, and more professionals to ensure universal access to quality services.<br><br>

                    <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
                    The ACA believes the Big Push represents a transformative opportunity for Ghana. It promises jobs, growth, and lasting development. We call on all Ghanaians to understand and support this bold vision.<br><br>

                    <strong>We stand with John Mahama in his mission to rebuild Ghana and provide the prosperity and stability that every citizen deserves.</strong><br><br>

                    <strong>Press Release</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Ghanaians Must Brace for More Errors, Discrepancies, and Irregularities by the Electoral Commission (EC)</strong><br>
                    <strong>Alliance for Civic Action (ACA)</strong><br><br>
              
                    Accra, Ghana – February 27, 2025<br><br>
                    The Alliance for Civic Action (ACA) expresses grave concern over the persistent errors, discrepancies, and irregularities in the operations of the Electoral Commission (EC) of Ghana. These ongoing issues have significantly eroded public confidence in the institution tasked with safeguarding the credibility of Ghana’s electoral process.<br><br>

                    Since the contentious 2020 elections, the EC has demonstrated a worrying pattern of lapses that undermine its mandate. Among the most notable incidents were the frequent adjustments to the results used to declare the presidential election outcome, which raised serious doubts about the integrity of the process. Additionally, the theft of registration kits and biometric verification devices (BVDs) from supposedly high-security environments has further dented the EC’s reputation.<br><br>

                    During the recent limited voter registration exercise, the EC itself admitted to discrepancies in voter registration data. Furthermore, instances of unauthorized voter transfers, errors in ballot printing, ballot shortages in regions such as Volta and Bono, and the retrieval and destruction of ballot papers have painted a troubling picture. Most recently, defaced ballot papers from the special voting exercise on December 2 resulted in voters in regions like Western and Eastern being rescheduled, highlighting a lack of preparedness and operational inefficiency.<br><br>

                    It is deeply concerning that these irregularities persist despite the EC’s assurances of improvement. The institution’s repeated admission of errors without meaningful corrective measures suggests either incompetence or the pursuit of an undisclosed agenda. The rescinded decision to limit media representation at collation centers further fuels suspicions of a lack of transparency and readiness for the upcoming 2024 general elections.<br><br>

                    Public trust in the EC has plummeted. Research shows that nearly half of Ghanaians doubt the Commission’s ability to conduct free, fair, and transparent elections. The EC Chairperson’s recent statement that “perfection should not be expected as we are only human” is both disheartening and unbefitting of an institution with the experience and resources to build a reliable electoral system.<br><br>

                    The ACA believes these repeated failures jeopardize Ghana’s democracy. As we approach the critical December 7, 2024, elections, we urge all political stakeholders, particularly opposition parties, to prepare their supporters for potential irregularities and errors. Orienting party members to respond calmly and lawfully will be crucial in preserving national peace and stability.<br><br>

                    We call on the Electoral Commission to redeem its image by ensuring a free, fair, and transparent electoral process. The EC must commit to addressing its systemic lapses, restoring public trust, and upholding its constitutional mandate to deliver credible elections.<br><br>

                    The Alliance for Civic Action remains committed to advocating for accountability and transparency in Ghana’s democratic processes. We hope every Ghanaian will join us in holding the EC accountable while maintaining the peace we cherish.<br><br>

                    God bless our homeland Ghana.<br><br>

                    <strong>Press Release</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>ACA Commends Supreme Court Justices for Upholding Democracy and Judicial Integrity'</strong><br>
                    <strong>Alliance for Civic Action (ACA)</strong><br><br>
              
                    Accra, Ghana – December 27, 2024<br><br>
                    The Alliance for Civic Action (ACA) expresses profound appreciation and commendation to the Justices of the Supreme Court of Ghana for their bold, impartial, and constitutionally grounded ruling on the re-collated parliamentary election results for Okaikwei Central, Ablekuma North, Tema Central, and Techiman South.<br><br>

                    This landmark judgment underscores the Supreme Court's critical role as the guardian of our democracy and a beacon of justice in ensuring the integrity of Ghana’s electoral process. By annulling the Electoral Commission’s (EC) declarations for these constituencies, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the foundational principles of fairness, transparency, and adherence to constitutional and procedural requirements.<br><br>

                    The ACA acknowledges the judiciary's commitment to addressing electoral irregularities decisively, which restores confidence in our judicial system. The ruling further amplifies the importance of due process and the protection of the rights of all citizens, including parliamentary candidates who sought a fair hearing in challenging the disputed re-collation process.<br><br>

                    We laud the presiding judge, Justice Gabriel Pwamang, and the entire panel for their meticulous and impartial examination of this case. By exercising their discretionary power to quash the orders of mandamus for re-collation in Okaikwei Central, Ablekuma North, Tema Central, and Techiman South, the Supreme Court has demonstrated its resolve to uphold the sanctity of Ghana’s democracy.<br><br>

                    The ACA also notes with satisfaction the Court’s clarification that, despite this annulment, the mandate to ensure due process in other unresolved constituencies remains intact. This approach reflects a balanced and judicious stance in preserving the rule of law and ensuring that no party is unfairly disadvantaged.<br><br>

                    We call on all Ghanaians to support the judiciary’s efforts to strengthen our democratic structures and ensure that justice prevails in every aspect of our national life. The ACA remains committed to working with all stakeholders to safeguard the democratic values we hold dear as a nation.<br><br>

                    Once again, we extend our gratitude to the Supreme Court for its determination, courage, and unwavering dedication to the principles of justice.<br><br>
